# w3d-vgui
An easy 3D vgui creation library in Garry's Mod

### Installation
1. Download the repo and copy the **w3d_vgui.lua** file into the **/lua/client/** folder of your addon/gamemode.  
2. Restart your server and have fun.  

*Don't forget to **include** the file clientside if you are using a custom loader!* ⚠️

### Usage
You can see multiple cases of usages in the **examples/** folder of the repo.  
The usage is pretty easy - anyway no documentation has been made yet.

### VGUI Elements types
At the moment, only theses exact types are available in the library:
- ``DButton`` - A simple button, copying the idea of the DButton vgui element.

Feel free to add your own elements and make a PR!
